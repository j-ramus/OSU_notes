## DC restoration

at t=0 -5v on left plat, which also has -5v on right plate

at t=0+3 - 0+4

$4\tao$ 99\% certain volatge

at 4,  $D_1$ will be on and vout is 0v

at $t=1+4\tao$, 10v

capicotr cannot be charged or discharged instantaneously

capactior will need a curretnt path to charge or discharge

if not mentioned, volatge is alwasys with respet to ground

When input voltage goes ot -5v, right plate of cap goes to 0

Choose a time constant in ltspice that is much lower than the period

## semiconductor currnt

1. p-type

- doped to lave less electrons than regular silicon

- Electrons want to jump out towards the positive voltage which gives it "holes" 

- the flow of holes



2. n-type

typess 

1. drift curretn

- happens under external electric fiels

$V_D$ drif veloxity of current carrier

$V_{d Holes} = \mu_h -E$

mobility of holes 

ease with which holes can move

(E= electric field)

$V_{de}\frac{cm}{s} = \mu_e \cdot E$ velocity elecront mooves

$\mu_h = 480\frac{cm^2}{Vs}$

$\mu_e= 1350\frac{cm^2}{Vs}$

$Vs=$ volt-seconds

electic fiels is in $\frac{V}{cm}$






bjts can act as resistive load

mosfets are a capacitive ;load
