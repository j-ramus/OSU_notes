# Lec -20

- look at lec-19 foumulas for CE CB CC

if beta and gm are the same circuit is symmetriacal

$Ro=\frac{vt}{it}=\frac{R+\frac{r\pi}{2}}{1+2gm\frac{r\pi}{2}}$

when $\beta = \infty$ avoid T model

### example 2; find Rout

current source is DC, open it for small signal analysis

in Rup $IDC \longrightarrow open$

Rup adn Rdn are in parallel because top is equivalent to AC ground and test current is going into the middle

from perspective of $i_t$ Rup is infinite

property of ideal DC current source is that current is constant irrespective of voltage across it.

because the DC current contiues to flow, the ac current comliment is not visible, only the fixed DC current

$R_o \frac{v_t}{it}=0 \quad \therefore \equiv \infty$

it = 0 because the ac voltage wave cannot vary the current

the voltage can swing like the it input, but current will not change

$R_{up}=\infty$ 

$\frac{vt}{it}$ will be a resistance

if $\beta=\infty \rightarrow r\pi=\infty\because r\pi=\frac{\beta}{gm}$

### Darlington pair

emmiter from frist transistor to base of next transistor, then conncect the collecotrs

$\beta multiplier$

power tansistors have low $\beta$

If trying to drive a load with

$R=r\pi_1 + (\beta_1+1)(r\pi_2+(\beta_2+1)R_E)$
