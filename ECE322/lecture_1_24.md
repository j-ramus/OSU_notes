# CVurrents and semiconductors

drift current


ptype - moving holes

ntype - moving electrons

$\mu$ = mobility

drift velocity dependent of electic field and mobility

ntype is faster than ptype

## Diffustopn current

- flow of carrier due to the concentration diffetence of carriiers

- distrobution of the concentration of holes

- simiilar to the way perfume would diiffuse throught a room

## Diode construction

- diodes are made of ptype connected to ntype

ptype has more holes, which are the majority carriers

- placing the types together makes the holes and electons and holes move into each oterh's type

ar soon as the hole moves to the ntype side that atom become positively charged.

all items are elctrically neutral in total, 

atomsa re in alttice structe, but dont move. the holes and electrons move to atoms on the other side

the atoms on the edges 

- within ntype, atoms on the edge become positive, atoms in ptype on edge become negative

this creates the depletion region

it is called depletion because it is depleted of all charge carriers

the positively charged atoms on the ntype side repel holes that want too come from the ptype side, 

the negatively charged atoms on the ptype repel electrons from the ntype side

when external electric filed is applied

- electrons flow in the opposite direction of E field

- the amount of field that allows the electrons to flow is the barrier (0.7v)

- ptype = anode; nytpe = cathode

- $E_{extrnal} > E_{barrier}$ for flow

### reverse bias

barrier field/ depletion zone increases 

holes and electrons are attracted to the outer edges of the p and n types

saturation current iw due to the minority carriers in each type (electrons on the ptype side and holes on the ntype side)

# BJT transistors

Bipolar junction

diode has one junction, BJTs have two

transistor: tansfer of resistance

two flavors

1. NPN

2. PNP

refers to ntype and ptype

- NPN

N: emmiter

P: base

N: collector

EBJ: emmiter base juntion

CBJ: collector base junction

when base junctions are forward biased, electrons in emiiter begin to move towards base.
as soon as they enter into the base, some (very few) electrons are going to go towards the base's source. thr rest move into the collector side.

wmmiter is where electrons are emmited

elctrons have to ve conserved

By KCL: $I_E=I_B+I_C$

realtionship has to do with the construction of the device

- thickness of layers (few nm to a few $\mu m$)
- doping
- power rating
