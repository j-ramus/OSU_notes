1. **Fetch and Merge Changes From Remote**
   Run the following command to fetch changes from the remote repository and merge them with your local branch:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --rebase
   ```
   - The `--rebase` option applies your local commits on top of the changes fetched from the remote.
   - This avoids creating a "merge commit" and keeps your history cleaner.

   > If there are no conflicts, the rebase will complete, and your local branch will now include the remote changes.

2. **Resolve Conflicts (If Any)**
   If there are conflicts between your changes and the remote changes, Git will pause the rebase and show you the conflicts:
   - Open the conflicting files, and manually resolve the conflicts.
   - After resolving, mark the files as resolved with:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Continue the rebase process:
     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

3. **Push Your Changes**
   Once the rebase is complete, push your changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   - If the rebase rewrote history, you may need to force push:
     ```bash
     git push origin main --force-with-lease
     ```
     The `--force-with-lease` option ensures that you don't accidentally overwrite any changes on the remote made by others after your last pull.

### **If You Want to Skip Merging Remote Changes**
If you are certain that you want to overwrite the remote repository with your local changes (and don't care about any remote changes):
```bash
git push origin main --force
```
- **Warning:** This will overwrite the remote branch and delete any commits that exist on the remote but not on your local branch. Use this only if you're sure the remote changes are not needed.

---

### **Recommended Approach**
It's best to **pull and rebase** the remote changes (step 1) to ensure you don't accidentally overwrite important work on the remote repository.
