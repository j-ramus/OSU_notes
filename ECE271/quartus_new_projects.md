# Create a New Project

- A project in Quartus is a collection of sources (Schematic or Hardware Description Language (HDL) files), testbenches, and simulation outputs. The project information specifies to Quartus what FPGA model you are working with and which synthesis tool to use, as well as some other parameters. Each project will compile all of its contained source files together, so you will create a new project for every lab section.

1.	Click File $\longrightarrow$ New Project Wizard 

2.	Click Next to advance. 

3.	Select a work directory where your project will be stored, and name your project. It is recommended that you create a ECE 272 folder in your Documents folder and separate folders for each lab within the ECE272 folder. Select your Lab1 folder as your directory for this project and click next.

4.	In Project Type, select an Empty project and click next
