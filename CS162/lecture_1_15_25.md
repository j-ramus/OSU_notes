# c++ continued

### parameters: 
placeholder

hypothetical

template of data types passed to fucntion when declared
written in declaration

### arguments

arguments: data passed in when called that match the parameters
written in function calls

---

when dividing two intergers c++ rounds down

^ = bitwise xor

pow(base, exponent) -> include <cmath>

just pow, not std::pow

---

### control flow

code that called function pauses while function is called

---

### Arrays

Declaration:
type array[size];

Calling:
array[index]



To initialize values:
type array[size] {frist, second, third,};
When using bool arrays, if first element set and no others, all the rest defualt to false



Array size must be hard coded at compile time. 
Cannot be resized, but you can overshoot the size needed
Arrays are homogenous: Must be same data type for all elements

if you pass an array as an argument to a function you dont have to put the size
void call(type[array]);
pass in a second parameter for size

call(array);

when array is passed as an argument it is passed by reference by defualt

---

### pointers and references

every time you create a variable that variable stores data, even if not initialized

the size oof that space is dictated by the variables type: example int = 4 bytes

some variables are stored in ram

Initially the variable is garbage

variables are the boxes for data which have a memory address

mempry addresses are just numbers




---

### portability

differences in compiler behavior and target machines

---





### python stuff
list comprehensions
